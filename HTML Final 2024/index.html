        <div class = "textbox1">IEEE network standards, developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, are essential rules that define how computers communicate in networks. Businesses worldwide rely on these standards, like Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), and VLAN (IEEE 802.1Q), to ensure smooth communication and data exchange. Wi-Fi allows wireless connectivity, Ethernet provides fast wired connections, and VLANs enhance security by dividing networks into smaller segments. Overall, these standards are vital for businesses, enabling efficient and reliable networking.</div>

         <div class = "titlebar2" > Brief Network Protocol History</div>

         <div class = "textbox2"> <p>The history of IEEE network protocols traces back to the early days of computer networking when the need for standardized communication protocols became apparent. In 1980, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) established the 802 Project, aimed at developing LAN (Local Area Network) and MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) standards. The first IEEE 802 standard, IEEE 802.3, commonly known as Ethernet, was introduced in 1983, laying the groundwork for wired networking. Over the years, the IEEE 802 series expanded to include various other standards, such as IEEE 802.11 for wireless networking (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.1 for network management and VLANs, and IEEE 802.15 for personal area networks (e.g., Bluetooth). These standards have evolved alongside advancements in technology, accommodating higher speeds, increased security measures, and improved efficiency. Today, IEEE network protocols serve as the backbone of modern communication infrastructures, enabling seamless connectivity and data exchange across the globe.
