Hello
These are some noteable projects/assignments I have created while attending Purdue University. 
Some of these assignments I worked on with a team, but most of these were done by me as I completed my weekly assignments. 
All of this code is free to use. I apologize for any mistakes in the source code, as this was all created with learning fundamentals as my priority.
